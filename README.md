#The story behind the picture

Most of the common-sense ideas about therapy-related leukemia turn out to be iffy:

#Bioinformatics:#

#Writing software/libraries/packages:#

Go read Jeff Leek's entire writeup.  It's better than anything I'm likely to write.  
https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages (Yes, it uses R, and since I'm trained as a statistician, so do I.)

The Python equivalent to a vignette is (roughly) the iPython notebook.  
http://ipython.org/notebook.html (if you write a Python package, you should write an .ipynb using it.)

We have been containerizing analyses into Docker images (not least because BaseSpace runs off of them).

#Statistics, design of experiments, and machine learning basics:#

Note: Substitute "data science" or whatever phrase you favor, if it makes you feel better

Tibshirani, Hastie, James & Witten's stat learning course: https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about

Susan Holmes' course on HMMs, R, etc.: http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats366/index.html

A list of (citable) Nature Methods feature columns: http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/08/giving_statistics_the_attention_it_deserves.html

The latter is nice because you can look up specific topics by name and then cite them in rebuttals. 


#Infrastructure:#

The following is mostly "how to move fast and break stuff".  You may or may not want to do that.  Choose wisely.

Srinivasan's startup engineering course: https://www.coursera.org/course/startup

Illumina BaseSpace developer's guide: https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/getting-started/overview

Specifically, the Native App tutorial:

One of these days I might properly put up my notes from last summer's bioinformatics course...  (--t)



#A few useful notebooks:#

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.anamnetic.com/INTD685/AntonsAssignment.ipynb (really simple python DE)

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.anamnetic.com/INTD685/alignmentAssignment.ipynb (really needs to be updated)

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/goo.gl/nqhwJb (HGVS nomenclature automatically via Python package)

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brentp/crystal/blob/master/notebooks/Introduction.ipynb (BrentP's crystal)
